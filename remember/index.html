	twin bed 
	just enough for one person. but really enough for two people. three? its long enough for us to sleep head to toe. it hard, but hard in a way that is so comforting. it has multiple quilts. one pillow. but i brought the pillow from the other twin bed. i actually like the other twin bed much more and i go there when i really want to sleep. after i spend hours half sleeping. its close to the window. i could never imagine going back to sleeping that way. two people in a twin bed. but i do miss when i didn't really care. that was all we had at the time. twin beds can make you feel really close. they make it impossible to not be close. and it makes me think of closeness and what closeness really means. its not the same thing as intimacy. or is it. i guess i'm confused about intimacy in general now. now that we don't share a twin bed. did i allow for it or did the twin bed allow for it. how close were we really? i loved sleeping in the other twin bed by myself. i never felt more tired or relaxed or ready to sleep than when i finally laid down in the other twin bed. it was firmer. and it was cool in temperature. and it had a really heavy quilt.

	Quincy St.
	a street between Downing and I'm actually not sure how far it goes. Certainly to Broadway. for three years I knew Quincy St between Bedford and Nostrand well. I knew my neighbors there and I knew the trees that weren't there. I knew the deli before it was filled with fancy snacks. I knew the hardware store that the daughter of the owners now runs a coffee shop in. Then for four years I lived on the next block. Quincy St between Marcy and Tompkins. And I remember walking down that stretch of block when lived between Nostrand and Bedford and wishing I lived there becuase there were lots of trees and these big red cement planters every few houses with different plants in them. Someone or many were taking care of that block in a different way. 234. 345. I came of age you could say. 23-32. in between i lived on sterling
